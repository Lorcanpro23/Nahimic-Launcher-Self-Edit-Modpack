# Nahimic-Launcher-Self-Edit-Modpack
By utilising the CodeOwners function, anyone trying to edit your modpack will require your permission, and ours.

By the way, this repo does nothing by itself, we use continous integration to push it to our repo server. Just create a folder with the desired repo name. Like, if I wanted Tomoli75.repo.nahimic.online I would type Tomoli75. All sub-folders are modpacks. A folder named DuckCraft under the repo folder would show up in the launcher as DuckCraft. We'll generate your launcher on our website.

# You may have to wait some time between changes here and the launcher updating, we only push every 5 minutes.
